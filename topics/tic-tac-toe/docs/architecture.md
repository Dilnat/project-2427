# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent - Architecture Documentation

## Project Definition

### Description

This project consists of implementing a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an artificial intelligence. The project is developed in Rust as part of the DevOps course.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn to implement a classic AI algorithm (Minimax)
- Discover game theory concepts
- Practice modular programming in Rust
- Manage a project with Cargo and Git

## Components and Modules

### Project Architecture

I organized the code into several modules to separate responsibilities:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs              # Entry point and main loop
â”œâ”€â”€ game/                # Game logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ board.rs        # Board representation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.rs       # Player types
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rules.rs        # Rules and win conditions
â”œâ”€â”€ ai/                 # Artificial intelligence
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ minimax.rs      # Minimax algorithm
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ strategy.rs     # Position evaluation
â””â”€â”€ ui/                 # User interface
    â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
    â””â”€â”€ cli.rs          # Command-line interface
```

### Module Descriptions

#### `game/` Module

- **board.rs**: Manages the 3x3 board state. I used a 1D array to simplify the implementation
- **player.rs**: Defines player types (Human/AI)
- **rules.rs**: Contains logic to detect wins and draws

#### `ai/` Module

- **minimax.rs**: Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- **strategy.rs**: Move evaluation system (score +1/-1/0)

#### `ui/` Module

- **cli.rs**: Handles board display and user interactions

### Design Choices

This modular architecture allowed me to:

- Clearly separate different parts of the project
- Facilitate debugging (each module has its own responsibility)
- Make the code more readable and maintainable
- Follow Rust best practices learned in class

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (installed via rustup)
- Cargo (included with Rust)

### Building and Running

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd topics/tic-tac-toe

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the game
cargo run
```

### Game Example

```
ðŸŽ® Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!
You are X, AI is O

Current board:
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
-----------
   |   |

Enter your move (1-9): 5

Current board:
   |   |
-----------
   | X |
-----------
   |   |

ðŸ¤– AI is thinking...
ðŸ¤– AI plays: 1

Current board:
 O |   |
-----------
   | X |
-----------
   |   |

Enter your move (1-9): ...
```

### Available Options

```bash
# Start a normal game
cargo run

# Debug mode (see AI calculations)
cargo run -- --debug

# Display help
cargo run -- --help
```

## Technical Details

### Board Representation

- I chose a 1D array `[Option<Player>; 9]` rather than a 2D array
- Simpler to manage and fast cell access
- Mapping: positions 0-8 for a 3x3 grid

### Artificial Intelligence Algorithm

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**:

- **Minimax**: explores all possible moves to choose the best one
- **Alpha-beta**: optimization that avoids exploring useless branches
- Result: the AI plays optimally (impossible to beat)

### Error Handling

- User input validation (only numbers 1-9 are accepted)
- Check that the chosen cell is free
- Clear error messages to guide the player

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Technical Problems

1. **Understanding the Minimax algorithm**: Initially, I struggled to understand the recursion principle and position evaluation
2. **Managing borrowing in Rust**: Ownership rules posed some challenges, especially for passing references between modules
3. **Modular organization**: Determining how to split the code into coherent modules

### Solutions Adopted

- Reading documentation and tutorials on Minimax
- Using official Rust examples to understand borrowing
- Several iterations on the architecture until finding a clear organization

        â””â”€â”€ cli.rs
```

## Possible Improvements

If I had more time, here's what I would add:

- Graphical interface with a library like `egui`
- Game saving functionality
- Different difficulty levels
- Game statistics
- Network multiplayer mode

## Personal Assessment

This project allowed me to:

- Discover AI algorithms applied to games
- Deepen my knowledge in Rust
- Understand the importance of good software architecture
- Learn to use Cargo to manage a project

The most interesting aspect was implementing the Minimax algorithm. Seeing the AI play optimally after coding its logic is very satisfying!
